# //query Starts a GraphQL query
# GraphQL requests can be either query (to get data) or mutation (to change data).
# Here we are reading data

# character(id: 1),it Calls the character field from the API, which fetches details for one character.
# (id: 1) means we are asking for the character with ID = 1.
# id: ID! in GraphQL means the API expects a non-null ID value (the ! means "required").

# Also, for each .graphql file, we must create a .json file showing the output from running that query.
